NOTE:

We have two folders named PRIVATE and PUBLIC.
reason for that is,
    - We CAN NOT allow visitors to see and inspect PRIVATE files of website
    - We have PUBLIC folder, which we will use for everything related to frontend
    - Very simple, PUBLIC is FRONTEND | PRIVATE is BACKEND
    
Our home/First file is index.php. Everything we build will be shown here.
if you want to make more pages (for example about.php), just make it in PUBLIC folder (without making any subfolders)

THERE IS ONE CHANGE IN PLAN*,
    As we discussed that we will try to make standalone webpage (one page only), I suggest we will think about it after project ends.
    because if we start doing from beginning our frontend and backend will have classes and overloading.
    Even more, We will have to work on one template for everything: about | contact| login | register | home etc...
    so I choose to make traditional website with NAVIGATION (use bootstrap) on top.
    We will try to assemble our project at the end.
